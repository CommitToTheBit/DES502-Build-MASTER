These 'folklore' clippings can be particularly long, and will be particularly relevant to setting the scene, and introducing the player to the game's more supernatural or folk horror elements. Obviously, there is a question of whether all this reading takes the player out of the game, but that shouldn't be felt so acutely in a full game."

This is placeholder text to show how newspaper clipping will look: the writer can add a heading and body text. These extracts can just as well relate directly to the narrative as give a broader sense of time and place. Indeed, if we're establishing our protagonist as a reporter meddling where they don't belong, I think using these snippets to emphasise the crassness of the British tabloid press can only strengthen that characterisation?
